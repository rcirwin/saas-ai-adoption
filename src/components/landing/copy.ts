      question: "Does this include implementation?",
      answer:
        "No. This assessment produces decision clarity and a concrete blueprint, not code. You'll know exactly what problems to solve, in what order, with what data. Implementation is a separate engagement or something your team can execute with the artifacts we deliver.",
    },
    {
      question: "What access do you need to our data?",
      answer:
        "We need read-only access to your data schema, product analytics, and user feedback channels. We do not need access to production databases or PII. We'll define the exact access requirements during intake and can work within your security constraints.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle security and confidentiality?",
      answer:
        "We sign a mutual NDA before kickoff. All work is conducted under strict confidentiality. We do not share findings, data, or artifacts with anyone outside the engagement. We can work within your existing security review process.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do we need to provide?",
      answer:
        "A Product Champion who can give us walkthrough access to product and subscription analytics, user feedback data, and access to engage with users for interviews and feedback. We provide a detailed intake checklist before we start.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take?",
      answer:
        "8 to 12 weeks from kickoff to final deliverables. The first two weeks are intake and discovery, the final weeks are review workshops. Most of the deep analysis happens in the middle phases with minimal disruption to your team.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does success look like?",
      answer:
        "You understand the real problems your users face in their workflows. You have a concrete plan for how AI solves those problems. You know how to prepare your product for an agent-driven future. And your team is aligned on what to build, what to protect, and what to skip.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this a one-time engagement or ongoing?",
      answer:
        "The assessment is a one-time, fixed-scope engagement. Some teams choose to engage us for implementation advisory afterward, but there's no obligation. The artifacts are designed to be useful on their own.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if we already have AI features in our product?",
      answer:
        "That gives us a head start. We evaluate what you've already built and planned, identify what's working, what's missing the mark, and where the gaps are. Then we build on that foundation rather than starting from scratch. The goal is to strengthen what exists, fill in blind spots with real workflow research, and connect everything into a coherent strategy for both user-facing AI and agent readiness.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if we think we already know our pain points?",
      answer:
        "Most teams do. But workflow mapping consistently reveals friction that was invisible from the inside. The AI opportunities that matter most are almost never the ones on the existing roadmap. This approach also surfaces critical data gaps, things that exist but aren't structured, exposed, or instrumented, before you start building.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does this help us decide what not to build?",
      answer:
        "The hardest part of AI strategy isn't finding opportunities. It's killing the ones that sound exciting but don't solve real problems. When teams see both dimensions, AI for users and agent-ready product, priorities shift. What seemed urgent becomes secondary, and what was invisible becomes the highest-leverage move. The assessment creates a shared framework for saying no.",
